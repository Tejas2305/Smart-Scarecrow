## 11/2/2025 - Research, Competitor Analysis and Feature Selection  

As this is my team project, we came up with the idea that the conventional scarecrows are not worth it, or they are inefficient at what they are doing. We need better ways to keep the intruders out, while still keeping it cost efficient,
We sat down and discussed a few things.
We found out he existing solutions for it and their key issues and the key features.
We found out there are many out there that are providing the smart scarecrow solution, but we can classify them into two broader categories. First ones are the ones that are low cost but do not do the job properly, like lack multiple features and seem closer to the traditional ones. The second category is the ones that are extremely expensive, like they cost around 50000 inr to 70000inr. They have all the advanced features, but at such a high cost, the indian farmers won't adopt it.
So then we discussed the features.
After consideration of cost and other factors, we thought of keeping these features.
1) a camera that will get the video for offline AI processing
2) a low range but accurate sensor
3) a long range heat sensor
4) a water pump with a nozzle to shoot water when a bird or other intruders come close
5) keeping it waterproof
6) rain sensors with vibation from other motors(so that no dropllets remains on it which will reduce the false alarms for it
7) Also, the AI will be detecting the birds and animals and based on its type, it will be using the buzzer and levels of lighting based on its type.
8) We also have a moisture sensor for getting the moisture in the soil, and also other sensors to get moisture in the air( we are using this data to predict the weather too
9) Keeping things simple, all the scarecrows will be covered with raincoats as waterproofing the head part, which has all the sensors, and the camera will be protected by an origami system umbrella, which will open and close using a servo motor when it rains
10) During rain, the scarecrow won't function due to safety mechanisms. We will shut down all power supplies except for the rain sensor; all other parts will be shut down
11) It will be working on Solar panels, and a battery, the battery will be charged by a Solar panel. In case of low charging, the battery can be swapped with a charged one, and the low-charging one can be charged at home using a power supply (for now, we are only thinking of the battery being charged using solar and not considering how they would be able to charge it at home, as its mechanism will not be designed by us right now)
12) We will be using a GSM module to send the sms to the farmers (as many rural areas in India are not in coverage of the internet, like the farm area only), so we will be sending critical alerts through the sms, like intruder detected, Rain is predicted, High moisture level, camera malfunction, low battery
13) main details like image of introducer and what action was taken, and will be stored in the SD card if provided, and can be taken into the app by connecting  to it using Bluetooth
14) For now, we have decided to use the Raspberry Pi 3 b+ as we feel it is sufficient for our project, and it also has Bluetooth
So that's all for the faeauters part, what we have finalized 
Also, we concluded that my team lacks the skills to make a full proof PCB in the first go, so we are not thinking that if making it a PCB design, we will be using the breadboard and components directly, and afterward we can learn about PCB designing and get one printed.
For now, for the hacklub and funding for it, we are planning to submit a CAD file, which will have the detailed mechanics of it and component placement.
Lastly, we also plan to go on a group visit soon and talk to farmers about what they need exactly and how much they will be ready to pay for it 
For now, we are thinking of going to Junnar, Pune, Maharashtra, India for it.
Here is the list of components we decided temporarily

More updates on it soon



Ai Refined one [without the component list]
As part of my team project, we embarked on a critical exploration of traditional scarecrows and concluded that they are largely inefficient in protecting crops from intruders. Our goal is to develop a more effective, cost efficient solution to safeguard the fields of farmers.

To kick off our project, we held a brainstorming session where we analyzed existing scarecrow solutions, pinpointing their key issues and essential features. We found that current market offerings can be categorized into two groups:

1. **Low-Cost Solutions**: While these scarecrows are affordable, they often lack multiple features and fall short of effectively deterring animals, making them closer to traditional scarecrows.
  
2. **High-End Solutions**: On the other end of the spectrum, we identified advanced scarecrow models priced between ₹50,000 to ₹70,000. Though these options come with numerous advanced features, their high cost makes them impractical for many Indian farmers.

After careful consideration of costs and functionalities, we outlined a list of viable features for our improved scarecrow design:

1. **Camera for AI Processing**: A camera that captures video for offline AI analysis to monitor activities in real-time.
  
2. **Low-Range Accurate Sensor**: To detect nearby intruders effectively.
  
3. **Long-Range Heat Sensor**: For identifying larger animals at a greater distance.
  
4. **Water Pump with Nozzle**: A mechanism to spray water at approaching intruders, helping to deter them.
  
5. **Waterproof Design**: Ensuring durability during adverse weather conditions.
  
6. **Rain Sensors**: Integrated sensors that prevent false alarms by eliminating droplets that may trigger the device unintentionally using a motor to vibrate it.
  
7. **AI Detection Capabilities**: The AI will classify intruders by type, adjusting the buzzer and lighting levels accordingly.
  
8. **Soil and Air Moisture Sensors**: These sensors will monitor soil moisture levels and help predict weather conditions.
  
9. **Protection Mechanism**: Each scarecrow will be fitted with a raincoat to ensure waterproofing, while the camera will be shielded by an origami-style umbrella that deploys using a servo motor when it rains.
  
10. **Safety Protocols**: During rain, the scarecrow will enter a safe mode, shutting down all power supplies except the rain sensor to ensure safety.
  
11. **Solar-Powered System**: The scarecrow will operate on solar panels with a rechargeable battery. In cases of low charging, the battery can be easily swapped for a fully charged one.
  
12. **GSM Module for Alerts**: To cater to rural areas that lack internet connectivity, we’ll utilize a GSM module to send critical SMS alerts to farmers—notifications will include intruder detection, rain predictions, high moisture levels, camera malfunctions, and low battery status.
  
13. **Data Storage**: Key details such as intruder images and actions taken will be stored on an SD card, accessible via a Bluetooth connection to an app.
  
14. **Processor Selection**: We have opted for the Raspberry Pi 3 B+ as it meets our project's needs and includes Bluetooth functionality.

As we finalize the features of our scarecrow, we acknowledge that our team currently lacks the skills to create a foolproof PCB design from scratch. Therefore, we plan to start with a breadboard and direct component connections. Once we gain more experience, we can transition to creating a PCB.

To aid in securing funding and support from the hack club, we are preparing to submit a comprehensive CAD file detailing the mechanics and component placement of our device. Additionally, we aim to gather insights directly from farmers about their needs and pricing expectations. Our team is planning a visit to Junnar, Pune, Maharashtra, India, to gain valuable perspectives from the farming community.

This project represents a significant opportunity not only to innovate within agricultural technology but also to make a tangible difference for farmers. We’re excited to bring these ideas to life and look forward to the feedback from our forthcoming visit.

## Visiting Junnar [ 23 November 2025 ]
after a long time i must say so after my previous log my exams had started so i could not do much of the tasks so now which i mean i had forgotten to put a log of it we had went to Junnar on previous sunday that is 23 November 2025. so as mentioned before we went to Junnar to do a kinda on ground survey like to ask farmers actually what do they want and at how much cost, we talked to multiple farmers about it and asked there needs and what actually matters which concluded about our features 
we also recorded few farmers while most of them where not comfortable for recording or were camera shy i will be attaching a video of a farmer talking about it

we found out that the main problem for the Junnar was that there are multiple wildlife or more specific tigers coming in there farms again and again  we also spoke to the forest officers present there they also considered this a great project

talking about the features part which we considered most of them had a idea of a drone based aerial detection but for lower cost that not possible we also came across 2 ideas which my team and i liked and considered implementing in our project 

1) Detection of fire and extinguishing using the existing water nozzle

2) A wire based fencing with low power to detect intruder which will be flowing current only at night  

so we will be adding these feature too now


for the proof of it i can give my bus tickets pdf too

## Visiting Satana
today that is 1 December me and my team also visited satana which is near Nashik

we also contacted multiple farmers here but most of them were not free to talk with us, they just told they were not free enough to talk and also seemed less interested still we tried contacting and asking out near 70 farmers out of which only 13 talked with us.

we explained them out features most of them said it was great but couldn't finds anything to add
for the cost range many suggested a cost rnage between 10000 inr to max 15000inr even if it had en number of feature they won't consider paying more than that

this visit dind't went too well with very few responses and none of them with additional features.


we travelled with personal vehicles there so we do not have tickets for it

i just have random photo clicked.

Honestly i had sped whole day there but it was not worth it so will be logging only 3 hours 


for tomorrow we plan to go to Sandip university to talk with the faculty and the students to if they have something which might help us like lets say dataset, knowledge or any sound data like which animal is scared of which kinds of sound

## Visiting Sandip University  [ 02/12/2025]
so well as planned me and my team visited tot he Sandip university to see if they have any similar project or there agriculture department could have some data related to it.

we visited there but unfortunately the the exams of agriculture department was going on, so we could not talk to the students about the idea. we still managed to talk with the faculty present there, they liked the project and told there was no such thing which they have heard of and also didn't have any data or knowledge related to it which might be helpful, all they gave us is the list of animals which mostly come into farms and cause damage so i consider it in nothing

after that we decided to ask the computer department for any data if they had, we manmaged to talk with few students there as there exams were not there, they like the idea and said there faulty could help us better and guided us to proper faculty there,

we meet there faculty which taught ai ds he told us how we can train our data and increase the recall [ not mentioned in journal but all these time side by side me and my team were working on ai and as well as design, our ai has 65% recall so] so we also discussed about the dataset and what should we do to avoid any mistakes it was kinda helpful stuff.


as exams were going on we were not allowed to carry our phones inside so we do not have any photo with the faculty or the inside part we still have the photos of the department from outside and also photos of the college ground for farming

## Started the design part
sop my half team which consist of 2 people from mechanical depart started working on the the drawing of it
they are using Autodesk AutoCAD for that purpose,

they first designed a very very rough thing on the paper with dimensions.
we ofc will be considering the digital designed part as our final model

so below is the image of the drawing which was hand drawn and also the digital one is in progress, my team is new to the digital drawing and will therefore will need more time to draw it as they first have to go through and learn about the features in the app

## Started with the ai training
so all this while it was not logged but me and my team member were finding dataset and using it as it is
we found out multiple dataset for different dataset like for cow, or wildlife there was no one dataset which is proper so merged multiple dataset and used roboflow for finding and managing the dataset 

here is the list of dataset which we merged

https://universe.roboflow.com/amritha-sreekanth/wildlife-ersho 
https://universe.roboflow.com/object-detection-h9cdg/cow-mxq1q
https://universe.roboflow.com/my-game-pics/my-game-pics
https://universe.roboflow.com/animal-detection-pwhj8/animal-repellent-system
https://universe.roboflow.com/ssdataset/isspjkt

so this all were merged into one
https://universe.roboflow.com/scarecrow-skyse/merger-ax44t

we also merged multiple class names which wee same but had different spellings or were not being considered same due to capitalizations,
we also used augmentation like noise and gray scaling in it.
so finally after merging we got these images per class
![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNzksInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--4e51e1841aead52e0b27d280d9fcc8ee2b505fd8/image.png)


so based on it we also trained a model on roboflow itself
which had kinda good results but we think we need a more better model
![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNjEsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--969238e00b075c1b950217ca091f313330e899fb/image.png)

![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNjQsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--cbdf5064709083c3cb3a8f80dab7f25c690c17cb/image.png)
![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNjUsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--6dd3df9bac2d4018d2d89f65caa20021a9c4e198/image.png)


after this we also considered training it using the code itself to see if that could yield some better results because we could then control the epoch values there
my laptop was not that capable of training a model on that large size of data so i considered using the google colab for it, the code was ai generated as i need a specific feature which was training the previous model and resume the training due to the session time limits on google colab
i know its pretty easy and standard process but initially i thought the process might be different so i took ai help just to know that it was near same stuff but now as the code was already generated i considered continuing with it

here is the link to its colab
https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1st0kZ4Z5MDjPEF0n1kkfzm29fgPTxrDc?usp=sharing

here are the results for it
![image](/user-attachments/blobs/proxy/eyJfcmFpbHMiOnsiZGF0YSI6MTgyNzMsInB1ciI6ImJsb2JfaWQifX0=--7dae05ae19f0c15814557ecc04dd384ff7d11a61/image.png)

here is the link to the csv file
https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zSV3NBq7mHu-Cl0zCr0FjFYWF_4t2c0a/view?usp=sharing

and also link to the folder which contains other details
https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1qy0e_5Vh5bV9xzzgGpDTxmiAlAyLIWWo?usp=sharing


so by this we concluded that we will be using the roboflow free trial for training our ai model from it,

and as mentioned in previous journals we talked with Sandip university faculty so to make our model better we will be going through each and every images to see what are the issues like the data being not labeled or data being not labeled properly and fixing it
and also we are finding more dataset so that match up the classes images so that all classes will have same number of images or atleast near same

as we found out the currently results are not valid plus it is detecting humans as cow

## Fixing the dataset
we and one more team member started finding more dataset as we wanted more data as it was not suffient or rather say its was not giving accurate results and anyways the hums and few things dataset was missing

while i was going through and annotating the already labeled dataset properly for the classes which were no included in it
i also annotated the things which were not included in the initial annotation

initial classes[https://universe.roboflow.com/ssdataset/isspjkt]

after me annotating it [https://universe.roboflow.com/scarecrow-skyse/dataset-1-isspjkt-done-4nasr]

## Finding more dataset
while i was fixing the dataset my other teammate was finding out more dataset 
as we didn't have the dataset for humans, monkey, birds, etc
also we had to make sure that all classes have near same number of images so we had to increase number of images for few particular classes
and also add the dataset for the fire so that we can detect fire 

Herer are the dataset links which all we found
we just haven't randomly put in the dataset links here we have checked all the dataset in a overview and then only pasted here
also they will be cross checked by me one image by image afterwards

## Note for the Hackclub
This project from start was part of my college project i was just think of making it and finishing it, i was just like its just a simple useless scarecrow who is going to use it anyways,
but this was all before starting of these event and more importantly meeting up the farmers offline.

After meeting up the farmers i just felt the real need of this projects and that when i started searching of this and taking this project more seriously, something so serious that now it is not just a college project for me. i want it to be something more than that, a project which can actually we used by multiple farmers out there which will be saving there crops and also there efforts to monitor there farms at night.

The main challenge i face now is funding even without external support my team and i are committed to funding the project ourselves but we do have financial limitations. Our current budget is limited to 5000 inr and we must rely on a rented Raspberry pi whenever we need to showcase the project this tight budget may force us to cut important features like water spraying or gsm module based on actual expenses and unexpected costs costs often exceed estimates because of component failures or other unforeseen issues.

To secure additional funding i have approached forest officers who have shared our proposal with their senior officers in hopes of getting government sponsorship however as with most government processes in India this will take time they have assured us that once the project is finished they would be interested in buying multiple units but they cannot fund a project that is still incomplete but that remains a possibility for the future.

Therefore i kindly request Hackclub to provide the full funding needed for my project with your support i can complete this project with all its planned features making it not only a valuable educational experience for me but also offering significant benefits to both farmers and the forest department.
